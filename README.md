{ 1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client who is developing an Android application for their game "Draw it or Lose it", a text based game which renders images which the users guess while they render. The users are divided into teams and and play three rounds to determine the winner. My team was responsible for updating the code to include functionality for adding players, teams, and using a singleton pattern to manage memory in a Java application. We also provided basic security authentication using Restful API and created a simple server using Maven, and were consulted on the driection of the parameters for the application. }

{ 2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
 
I think I was pretty rounded while developing this document but I don't think I did anything particularly well. }

{ 3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document was essential to developing the code, especially when it came to the UML diagram, which streamlines how the different objects interact with each other and gave a clear structure to the classes. }

{ 4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would pick the security memory management sections if I had to revise the document, I still feel like I I have a very basal understanding of these concepts and I need to spend more time exploring and understand them. }

{ 5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

No matter what industry you are in the needs of the user always come first. The whole reason you design software is to grow a user base, which requires the user to decide that they want to use your software over your competitors software. The user does not care what laguage you use, what tools you use or how the software was created, they simply want an application that is easy to use and fulfills their needs of the software. }

{ 6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Fortunately the approach was very guided in our assignments, but I would like to use something similar going forward. The design template highlights the goals and suggestions to give direction to the development of the software, and having a UML diagram streamlines the development of code by outlining what the code needs to accomplish with structure. }
